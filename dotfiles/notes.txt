I work on a variety of machines and often over a terminal to client systems, so I don't
spend a lot of time customizing these environments. The exceptions are the editors and
terminals. I set my terminals to white on black schemes and set some no nonsense options
for vi/vim and nano.

I tend to customize my environment by making sure I always have the right tools. I've
included a sample of the general purpose tools I like to keep in my local bin directory.
Here's a summary of the tools:


bin/clkpg - show timings for fetching a web page
- This uses curl to fetch a file from a uri and shows a break down of the time required.
These times are show as time from the start, so you have to subtract the previous time
to get just the deta for any particular op:
time for dns lookup
time to establish a connection
time until the transfer starts - basically script processing time
time for transfer to complete

bin/tunnel - establish an ssh tunnel to a remote server
- This one is newer. It will need an option to set the local port and be able to show
usage, etc.

bin/fixtabs - convert leading spaces to tabs
- A more mature tool, this bash script does a batch transformation of indenting spaces
to tabs. It handles the temp files automatically for in place editing and lets you
specify the number of spaces in the original "tab" size.

rmcr - remove carriage return characters
- This can easily be done with sed or tr, but I wanted a way to fix multiple files in
place and I wrote this before I knew about sed -i. This app takes care of temp file
management.

realpath - show the full expanded path of a file or directory
- There is ever more frequently a distro tool for this, but I still keep it for systems
that don't have it.


I frequently work over sshfs and one thing I like to do is setup my sshfs mounts in
/etc/fstab. I show the general format for that in fstab.sshfs. This is nice time saver
and lets me mount a remote share with: mount <mount path>
