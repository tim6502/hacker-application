Resume Demo
by Tim Graham


Quick Start:
make && ./resume


Requires:
- gcc
- ncurses


Notes:
- for Linux terminal, optimized for standard 80x24 and color (xterm...)
- press any key when the animation is complete to exit, or hit ctrl-c at any time


Known Issues:
- the background may appear gray instead of black under gnome-terminal
-- this is because its default palette (Tango) uses a light gray for black
-- check Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Colors -> Palette
-- select a different palette or change the first color to black
